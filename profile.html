                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>In 2001 my business partner and I founded <a href="https://www.gravitate.co.nz">Gravitate.co.nz</a> when we launched Artfind.co.nz,
                    a repository and service for New Zealand artists and galleries to promote themselves. Over the next 20 years we grew Gravitate
                    into a full service web agency providing strategy, design, ux, development, implementation and hosting to a wide
                    range of businesses and charities.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My role within Gravitate as Technical Director is primarily focused on application analysis, architecture planning, software
                    development, infrastructure, tooling, developer support and security. I have worked with technologies such as PHP, Javascript,
                    Go and Terraform to help solve problems for clients and our development team. I have strong experience with Linux and a deep understanding
                    of internet technologies and adapt well to new tools and development environments and languages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy solving problems and writing software and have a strong interest in not only developing solutions but also contributing back to
                    community projects and tools that I use. I have contributed to the Johnny 5 javascript robotics framework, bug fixes to libraries such as RayGun and GPSD, and the Terraform provider
                    and Go library for our hosting partner Sitehost.

                            The Farmer Brown Golden Egg Hunt was an AR experience developed in partnership with <a href="https://www.workcommunications.co.nz">Work Communications</a> to promote Farmer Brown eggs.
                            The game made use of <a href="https://www.8thwall.com">Niantic 8thwall</a> to create an interactive egg hunt and used
                            a combination of <a>Open Street Map</a> data and random points to create collectable eggs for people to find and collect.
                            Upon finding an egg users could then switch to a camera mode to view the egg in the real world and collect a prize.

                        <p>
                            Golden Egg Hunt made use of various social login mechanisms from Facebook, Google and Apple to create a simple login flow that respected end users' privacy by only collecting user data when needed.
                            The database was optimised for geospatial data and also allowed for detailed reporting and analysis.

                            Myhumm is a React based portal for honey producers to place orders for honey lab tests, view their test results, create custom reports, and run blending optimisations.
                            It provides an API that is used by Gribbles Scientific's laboratory systems to handle the placement of orders, update statuses, and collect results. It also provides
                            a honey blending optimiser service that takes a set of test results and optimises the blending of honey to meet a set of requirements.

                        <p> Hika was a language learning tool that was developed by a Language education specialist from the University of Auckland to assist
                            people learning Te Reo Māori through the use of high frequency words and phrases. The first release of the application
                            made it to the top of the app store in New Zealand.

                        <p>
                            Subsequent versions of the application also included tools for assembling the language resource packs and the ability to purchase
                            and download new language sets from a centralised server.

                        <p>It was released not long after the iPhone 3g was released and I implemented early prototypes along with the first release version. I then
                            managed subsequent releases and updates with our design team and external mobile developers.</p>
