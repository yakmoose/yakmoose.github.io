                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>
                    In 2001 my business partner and I founded <a href="https://www.gravitate.co.nz">Gravitate.co.nz</a> when we launched Artfind.co.nz,
                    a repository and service for New Zealand artists and galleries to promote themselves. Over the next 20 years we grew Gravitate
                    into a full-service web agency providing strategy, design, ux, development, implementation, and hosting to a wide
                    range of businesses and charities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My role within Gravitate as Technical Director has been primarily focused on application analysis, architecture planning, software
                    development, infrastructure, tooling, developer support, and security. I have worked with technologies such as PHP, JavaScript,
                    Go, and Terraform to help solve problems for clients and our development team. I have strong experience with Linux and a deep understanding
                    of internet technologies and adapt well to new tools and development environments and languages. I led the team of developers at Gravitate and mentored junior staff.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I enjoy solving problems and writing software and have a strong interest in not only developing solutions but also contributing back to
                    community projects and tools that I use. I have contributed to the Johnny 5 JavaScript robotics framework, fixes to libraries such as RayGun and GPSD, and the Terraform provider
                    and the Go library and Terraform provider for our hosting partner Sitehost.

                        <p>
                            The Farmer Brown Golden Egg Hunt was an AR experience developed in partnership with <a href="https://www.workcommunications.co.nz">Work Communications</a> to promote Farmer Brown eggs.
                            The game made use of <a href="https://www.8thwall.com">Niantic 8thwall</a> to create a mobile egg hunt game. The game gave away $100k of prizes each year it ran.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The mobile game was an interactive egg hunt that presented the user with a 3d map of their surroundings and a mixed reality view to collect the eggs once found. People could
                            then collect eggs to obtain prizes. Game application was responsible for tracking available and collected eggs, user onboarding, prize redemption, and reporting.

                            with our design team to wirefame the workflows and user interface. I was then responsible for the full implementation of the game and supporting systems.
